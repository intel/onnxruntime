# Plugin Execution Provider Libraries
An ONNX Runtime Execution Provider (EP) executes model operations on one or more hardware accelerators (e.g., GPU, NPU, etc.). ONNX Runtime provides a variety of built-in EPs, such as the default CPU EP. To enable further extensibility, ONNX Runtime supports user-defined plugin EP libraries that an application can register with ONNX Runtime for use in an ONNX Runtime inference session.

This section provides a reference for plugin EP libraries.
